# Value in the NFL Draft

## Goal of the Study
Every year the 32 NFL teams draft to select the next generation of NFL players. With the order going from worst to best record in the previous season, it's where teams try to ensure future success. What I wanted to analyze was if current methods used to value draft picks was optimal, and to see how important drafting is for team success.
## Draft Pick Value
According to Bill Belichick, all NFL teams use about the same valuation for draft picks, ESPN lists what is the consensus for the value of each pick. Under this valuation each pick is worth increasingly less than the previous pick. The valuation is used to make trades of draft picks; if you offer picks of equal or greater value it should be accepted.
## Player Value
When trying to find out a measure of player value that allowed for comparison across position I found a metric from Pro Football Focus called Approximate Value. The formula was created for just this purpose and uses a variety of statistics to determine the final product. The creator of Approximate Value, Doug Drinen, explained:
"AV is not meant to be a be-all end-all metric. Football stat lines just do not come close to capturing all the contributions of a player the way they do in baseball and basketball. If one player is a 16 and another is a 14, we can't be very confident that the 16AV player actually had a better season than the 14AV player. But I am pretty confident that the collection of all players with 16AV played better, as an entire group, than the collection of all players with 14AV."
For this project I used Weighted Average Value, as it values players with high peaks over those with consistent numbers over long careers. This helps account for injuries that derail promising careers, as well as that one exceptional season is much more likely to help win a super bowl, the ultimate goal of all NFL teams.
## Dataset Being Used
For this project I decided to use players drafted fro 2000 until 2022. The reason I used 2000 is not simply because of the new milenium, but because 2000 is the earliest draft class that had an active player in the 2022 season, Tom Brady. I combined all of the data from each draft class listed on Pro Football Reference into one spreadsheet, starting with Courtney Brown and ending with Brock Purdy.
